about 35 miles away.. give or take.. but close enough yes
Laskowski, Leszek
2:31 PM
trying to buy something overe there
and looking for good place
sort of strategic to find jobs

LL
Laskowski, Leszek
2:32 PM
do you know any place like this ?

My highest recommendation is Gilbert AZ
Amazing area....but budget will matter
Laskowski, Leszek
2:33 PM
ohh, great

LL

DN
Nick, Daniel W
2:33 PM
Gilbert is close to everything, but doesnt feel bogged down like a large city
Laskowski, Leszek
2:33 PM
what about Chandler ?

LL

DN
Nick, Daniel W
2:33 PM
Chandler is right beside Gilbert and is decent, but not as nice.. again.. that depends on your budget

DN
Nick, Daniel W
2:34 PM
Chandler is older than Gilbert... so its really about your priorities
if you want a place with a lot of sq ft.. then Gilbert
Laskowski, Leszek
2:34 PM
perfect
good info

LL

DN
Nick, Daniel W
2:34 PM
If you are ok with a smaller place ... slightly less planned city.. then Chandler
Laskowski, Leszek
2:34 PM
will start over there

LL

DN
Nick, Daniel W
2:35 PM
Gilbert, Queen Creek, Some Mesa
Chandler is ok, but i didnt personally like it... felt cramped
If you dont mind a commute.. you can get fantastic homes in San Tan Valley

DN
Nick, Daniel W
2:36 PM
but thats a much further commute and not as close to big business
Laskowski, Leszek
2:36 PM
what about Carefree
?

LL

DN
Nick, Daniel W
2:37 PM
im not familiar with Carefree
Laskowski, Leszek
2:37 PM
and you, what town are you ?

LL

DN
Nick, Daniel W
2:37 PM
Im in Queen Creek..   Ive lived in Chandler, Gilbert, San Tan Valley, and now Queen Creek
Laskowski, Leszek
2:38 PM
they are building a lot in Qeen Creek

LL

DN
Nick, Daniel W
2:38 PM
its really about budget here.. for instance.. my home is like 290K where I live..
but i could buy the same home in San Tan for 70K less
Laskowski, Leszek
2:39 PM
ohh, big difference indeed

LL

DN
Nick, Daniel W
2:39 PM
yes... Queen Creek has a ton of new builds, but its less strategic than Gilbert if you plan to go to Phoenix..

DN
Nick, Daniel W
2:40 PM
high HOA's here.. so be aware of that for your bottom line budget
some HOA's are over 100 a month
Laskowski, Leszek
2:41 PM
we trying to avoid HOA

LL

DN
Nick, Daniel W
2:42 PM
that will be very difficult
Laskowski, Leszek
2:43 PM
we just found very nice home in Surprise
but it is more west
no HOA
and only 220K

LL
Laskowski, Leszek
2:46 PM
thanks for the info, very valuable ...

LL

DN
Nick, Daniel W
2:48 PM
Surprise is a bit of a hike but I like it
you are very close to the high crime area though
Laskowski, Leszek
2:48 PM
ohh, really
wow

LL

DN
Nick, Daniel W
2:48 PM
but..suprise is very safe itself

DN
Nick, Daniel W
2:49 PM
one of the safest
Laskowski, Leszek
2:49 PM
i see

LL

DN
Nick, Daniel W
2:50 PM
if you get a chance.. come down.. drive around a few of hte cities
get a feel
Laskowski, Leszek
2:50 PM
yup
my daughter wants to move
so we thinking investing and she will be staying

LL
Laskowski, Leszek
2:51 PM
and at the same time maybe we will try over there as well
my Daughter is familiar with Chandler

LL
Laskowski, Leszek
2:52 PM
so probably we will start there

LL

DN
Nick, Daniel W
2:52 PM
that would be great..  i could use a new neighbor   
Laskowski, Leszek
2:52 PM
yeah  why not
